# pyvin
This is a program used to scroble vinyl records on last.fm.  It reads the time, name, and album of each track and scrobbles them when you chose to.  `pybc.py` is a script that can be used to create the text file that has all the times in it automatically if it is an album on bandcamp.  It's very rough but it works.
